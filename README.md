## Goal
Provide a "starter kit" for Kinect *skeleton tracking*, and adding some cool features ! 💥

## Ideas
- [ ] A skeleton moving with "easing movements" ➰
- [ ] Faces, arms, legs... draw and projected on a skeleton 👹
- [ ] A hand-drawer skeleton ✏️
- [ ] A skeleton interacting with generate environment (or 3D objets) 🙌
- [ ] Skeletons interacting with each others 💀👉💀

## Debugging Mode
The function `displayInfos(boolean)` allows you to see if the Kinect detects users, what are the numbers of users, if the tracking is successful...etc. You can turn it on/off with `true` or `false` as a parameter.
